These papers were the results from Lab Assignments/Projects as a part of my Advanced Topics in Data Analytics class (DA 350) at Denison University. 
The majority of these papers were group assignments.

These papers represent my ability to synthesize data into useful information, specifically given the context of the data. 
These Data labs are significant because they both demonstrate my knowledge of realistic data analytics techniques as well as demonstrate my ability to work with real world datasets. 
(All datasets used were taken from real sources). 
The format of each assignment was that we were given a set of real world data and a list of questions we needed to answer about the data. 
This came both in the form of open ended questions and some quantifiable questions. 
We then were to write a short paper summarizing both our methods in analyzing the data and our results to the questions given. 
We also had to provide some relevant charts and graphics about the data.
